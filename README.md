This is the backend of my full-stack Yolo project (https://github.com/antti-kuru/Yolo). This project enables customers to give feedback and suggest foods they would like to eat on the restauraunt. Feedback can be given in three buttons, good/neutral/bad and when feedback is given a table shows the responses. The suggestions are stored in MongoDB so the website always shows the up-to-date list of suggested foods. In frontend when suggesting a food that already exists the quantity of the original suggested food is increased, I'm currently working on managing this on the backend. 



Technologies used
