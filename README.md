This is the backend of my full-stack Yolo project (https://github.com/antti-kuru/Yolo). Next step is to store the proposals in real database (MongoDB). This is my first full-stack project so there might be some bugs so be careful. The goal with this project is for me to get familiar with web development and what aspects it contains.
